                <h2>How it works:</h2>
                <p>This tool calculates mineral and vespene income depending on the amount of workers per base, just like in a game of Starcraft 2.
                    Each vespene geyser in this tool can only hold up to 3 workers because after 3 the vespene collection rate will not increase any significant amount.  Mineral lines
                    on the other hand can hold up to 24 workers (3 on each mineral node), after which there are no significant returns.  However, 16 workers
                    on minerals (2 on a node) is ideal since the first 2 workers on a node will collect minerals faster than the third worker.  I chose to
                    allow users to go up to 24 workers on a mineral line, but if you want to find the optimal saturation 
                    for a base then just click the 'optimal saturation' button.  All of this is assuming of course that we are on a base with 8 mineral nodes
                    and 2 non-empty geysers.  As well this tool does not take other factors into account, such as Terran Mules, gold mineral nodes, and
                    rich vespene geysers.
                </p><br>
                <p>I admitedly did not do my own testing for the stats I gathered for mineral and gas collection rates; all rates are based on  
                    <a href="https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/501306-comprehensive-lotv-production-spreadsheet">this Team Liquid post</a> from a while back.  These stats
                    are of course just ballpark estimates so take that for what it is!
